# GaanaPy

An unofficial JSON API for [Gaana](https://gaana.com), an Indian music streaming service. Built with FastAPI.

## Production Music Hub backend

This repository now also contains an authenticated, personalized API under
`music_hub/`. It keeps GaanaPy as the catalog provider while adding Firebase
Google authentication, internal UUID users, Supabase PostgreSQL persistence,
optional Redis/Upstash caching, personal libraries, playlists, history, events,
cursor-based recommendations, and an aggregated home feed.

The original API remains available with `uvicorn app:app`. The production API
runs separately with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m uvicorn music_hub.main:app --reload
```

See [PRODUCTION_BACKEND.md](PRODUCTION_BACKEND.md) for setup, architecture,
database migration, Firebase configuration, Flutter authentication, and the
API v1 endpoint map.

## Usage

Start the server (see [Local Development](#local-development)), then open the interactive docs:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Endpoints

All endpoints return JSON. List endpoints accept an optional `limit` (1–100, default 10). Artist tracks also accepts `page` (1–1000, default 1).

| Endpoint | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /songs/search?query=` | Search songs | `query` |
| `GET /songs/info?seokey=` | Song details | `seokey` |
| `GET /albums/search?query=` | Search albums | `query` |
| `GET /albums/similar/?album_id=` | Similar albums | `album_id` (numeric) |
| `GET /albums/info?seokey=` | Album details (includes tracks) | `seokey` |
| `GET /artists/search?query=` | Search artists | `query` |
| `GET /artists/tracks/?artist_id=` | Tracks by an artist | `artist_id` (numeric) |
| `GET /artists/info?seokey=` | Artist details (with top tracks) | `seokey` |
| `GET /artists/similar?artist_id=` | Similar artists | `artist_id` |
| `GET /trending?language=` | Trending tracks | `language` |
| `GET /newreleases?language=` | New releases | `language` |
| `GET /charts` | Top chart playlists | — |
| `GET /playlists/info?seokey=` | Playlist details (with tracks) | `seokey` |
| `GET /health` | Health check | — |

### Language

`English`, `Hindi`, `Punjabi`, `Tamil`, `Telugu` etc. Case-sensitive.

### Finding a seokey

A **seokey** is the URL-friendly identifier from a Gaana page:

```
https://gaana.com/song/tyler-herro        → tyler-herro
https://gaana.com/album/tyler-herro       → tyler-herro
https://gaana.com/artist/jack-harlow      → jack-harlow
https://gaana.com/playlist/gaana-dj-...   → gaana-dj-gaana-international-top-50
```

Search results also return `seokey`, `artist_seokeys`, and `album_seokey`.

### Finding an artist ID

Artist IDs are numeric. Get them from search results:

```
GET /songs/search?query=tyler herro
→ [{ "artist_ids": "817522", ... }]
```

### Examples

```sh
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/songs/search?query=tyler+herro&limit=5"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/songs/info?seokey=tyler-herro"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/albums/info?seokey=tyler-herro"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/albums/similar/?album_id=3487503&limit=5"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/artists/info?seokey=jack-harlow&limit=5&page=1"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/artists/tracks/?artist_id=817522&limit=5&page=1"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/artists/similar?artist_id=817522"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/trending?language=English"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/newreleases?language=English"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/charts"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/playlists/info?seokey=gaana-dj-gaana-international-top-50"
```

Similar albums and artist tracks require numeric IDs. Results depend on Gaana's live catalog and the headers accepted by its current website endpoints.

### Discovery endpoints

`GET /albums/similar/` requires a numeric Gaana `album_id` and returns normalized album records. The album must exist in Gaana's current catalog; otherwise the API returns a 404 no-results response.

`GET /artists/tracks/` requires a numeric `artist_id` and returns a paginated object containing `tracks` and `total`. Use `limit` for the number of tracks per page and `page` to select the page. Track records include the same metadata and `stream_urls` fields as `/songs/search/`.

These endpoints depend on Gaana's live catalog and current website request headers, so results may change or be unavailable for individual IDs.
